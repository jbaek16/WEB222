                <h5><a id="q1">1. Explain the concept of Responsive Design.
                        What does the term mean? What did you discover in your research?</a> </h5>

                <p class="answer">
                    &emsp;Responsive design is a method of building a website that does not depend on the screen size of
                    the
                    device.
                    In other words, it is a design that adjusts the size or/and the arrangement of the web page
                    depending on
                    the window width of the device and automatically switch to the easy-to-see display.<br /><br />
                    &emsp;Responsive design is a great way to provide "easy-to-read and easy-to-use" web sites for an
                    increasing number of mobile users. <br /> <br />
                    &emsp;In my research, I discovered that responsive design does not need to create separated PC and
                    mobile sites.
                    We only need to build one common website and prepare one type of URL or HTML for each page, because
                    the
                    design such as the display width is controlled by CSS rather than HTML.
                    Also, I discovered that responsive design corresponds to "Mobile First Index" and "Mobile
                    Friendly"<br /><br />
                    &emsp;The simplicity of this site structure is one of the characteristics of responsive design and
                    is a
 factor that brings many benefits.
                </p><br />

                <h5><a id="q2">2. How does responsive design relate to web technologies?
                        How can web pages take advantage of it?</a> 


                <ul class="answer">
                    <li>Especially for a small screen such as a smartphone, it improves ease of viewing and ease of use.
                    </li>
                    <li>One URL makes it easy for users to link and share. For instance, if there is a mobile site for
                        smartphone and pc site for personal computers, you must send a different URL to match the device
                        of
                        the user you want to show.
                    </li>
                    <li>It corresponds to "Mobile First Index" and "Mobile Friendly", so it will be displayed at the top
                        of
                        the search results.</li>
                    <li>Because URL, HTML, and CSS are one source, it is easy to update and maintain.</li>
                </ul><br />

                <h5><a id="q3">3. What techniques, technologies, and patterns did you use in your responsive
                        design?</a> </h5>

                <p class="answer">
                    I used liquid layouts.
                    This technique uses percentages to specify the width. Also, I used min-width and max-width to keep
                    element's min or max size to keep user's view clear and easy-to-see.</p><br />

                <h5><a id="q4">4. What did you learn about building web apps for different devices? </a></h5>

                <p class="answer">
                    I've learned that the responsive design is very important concept in web develop technology. <br />
                    With smartphones becoming more popular and the use of SNS flourishing, creating a website
                    considering
                    the easy-to-see design and ease of sharing them will greatly affect the customers' businesses.<br />
                    I would like to learn more about efficient web design (including advanced responsive design )so that
                    I
                    can create customer’s websites more productive.
