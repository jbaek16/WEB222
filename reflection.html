                <h5><a id="q1">1. Explain the concept of Responsive Design.
                        What does the term mean? What did you discover in your research?</a> </h5>

                <p class="answer">
                    &emsp;Responsive Web design shouldn't be just about how to create a flexible layout on a wide range of platforms and screen sizes.
                    he white space around the content on larger screens is also more spacious and interesting, whereas it is simplified for practical purposes on smaller screens.
                    In other words, esponsive design is a method of building a website that does not depend on the screen size of the device. 
                    and it is a design that adjusts the size or/and the arrangement of the web page depending on the window width of the device and automatically switch to the easy-to-see display.
                    In this assignment, I made a separate design of PC and Mobile. However, we found other environments where some sizes and images do not respond.

                <h5><a id="q2">2. How does responsive design relate to web technologies?
                        How can web pages take advantage of it?</a> 


                <ul class="answer">
                    <p>- Especially for a small screen such as a smartphone, it improves ease of viewing and ease of use.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>- Users can share with others if they want.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> It is easy to update and maintain with a simple host.</p>

                <h5><a id="q3">3. What techniques, technologies, and patterns did you use in your responsive
                        design?</a> </h5>

                    sing this line will allow our browsers to control the page's dimensions and scaling <br>

               In the CSS file.However, due to size issues, the source for "@media" was not used. </p><br />

                <h5><a id="q4">4. What did you learn about building web apps for different devices? </a></h5>

                <p class="answer">
                    I've learned that the responsive design is very important concept in web develop technology. <br />
                    By implementing the existing used structure, I realized how much time and collaboration designers needed. Also, I have come to believe that it can be fully implemented in the process of making it.
