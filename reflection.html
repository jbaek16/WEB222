    <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
    <p class="REFLECTION">At first, Responsive Design is a type of web design that the programmer can write their website
         once and it can run everywhere, on any platform instead of building separate sites. With the
        Responsive design the element can adapts to any screen such as tablet, phone, laptop or desktop.
        The responsive save a lot of time of programmer avoiding building many different versions for a
        same content. Today, the high technology industry is developing rapidly that people can not live
        without a smartphone or other devices. In order to adapt to different screen of the user,
        the web developer must use responsive design to deal with it. For example, when people access
         to your website from different devices, the web will show its content in different ways like
        on the phone the web usually show on the same column, but on the desktop usually has the aside
        part to contain more advantage of the bigger screen.  In this assignment, I used “@media” technique
        that help adjust the content depend on the screen by the syntax: @media screen and (expression){ code in here }
         where expression is the how you screen going to run the code inside depend on the expression. For me, with the maximum
        the size of width is 960 then I chose the expression is max-width: 960 and the code inside is the body with the width 
        is 100% depend on the screen width can be smaller and the website would be fit on it. For different devices, we must focus on
        how our website will show that must be friendly with the user and clearly when the user opens your website by using responsive
        design technique. </p>
